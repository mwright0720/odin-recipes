    <h3> Description: </h3>
    <p> I like pizza </p>
    <h4> Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Pizza </li>
        <li> More cheese </li>
        <li> Maybe some french fries if you're REALLY hungry</li>

    </ul>

    <h4> Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Get the pizza</li>
        <li> If the pizza is not already cooked, then put it in the cooking device of choice</li>
        <li> Make sure to take the pizza out of the box if you cook it or else you will have a fire which isn't good</li>
        <li> On the cooked pizza, put your extra cheese or french fries if you feel the pizza needs it</li>
        <li> Make sure to eat the crust it is there for a reason</li>
        <li> Delicious! </li>

    </ol>
